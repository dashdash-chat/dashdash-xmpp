Like the [vine-xmpp repo](https://github.com/lehrblogger/vine-xmpp), basic configurations of nginx and supervisor are set up by the vine_shared Chef cookbook in the [vine-chef repo](https://github.com/lehrblogger/vine-chef), and this piece of the application expects that cookbook to have run. This repo adds several copies of the leaf_component program to supervisor, which need to be started manually. After one or more is running, connect in the XMPP client of your choice as admin1@dev.vine.im, and send a message to leaf@leaves.dev.vine.im.

Hopefully the code is sufficient to explain how everything is supposed to work, but see the vine-chef repo for more information.
